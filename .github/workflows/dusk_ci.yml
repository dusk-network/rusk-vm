  # We don't run `cargo check` on this repo, since
  # it will only pass if a build has been previously
  # performed. Hence, it is a better idea to only run
  # tests.

  # We don't test on stable for this repo, since
  # no_std and other things in this library
  # depend on the nightly toolchain.
